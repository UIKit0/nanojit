This is a minimal clone of [NanoJit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Nanojit) with only the required bits for using the JIT + some of my own files to make it work as a freestanding JIT. Some NanoJIT files might have modifications compared to the originals, see the commit history for details where the initial commit contains the original files.
